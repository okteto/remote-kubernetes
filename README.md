# Remote - Kubernetes


The **Remote - Kubernetes** extension uses Okteto to move your development environment to Kubernetes. 

Kubernetes, Okteto and VS Code make a great development environment because you can:

- Launch reproducible development environment with all your tools in seconds.
- Automatically synchronize your code between local and remote environments.
- Eliminate integration issues by developing the same way code runs in production.
- Keep using your favorite tools.
- Forget about building images or redeploying containers to test your changes in Kubernetes.

The extension starts a development environment in your Kubernetes cluster by using https://github.com/okteto/okteto. Once the environment is ready, the extension prompts you to open it directly in VS Code using the [Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension.

## Requirements

1. VS Code 1.39 or newer.
1. Deploy access to a Kubernetes cluster (you can use https://cloud.okteto.com/, Okteto's free managed Kubernetes service for developers).
1. An OpenSSH compatible [SSH client](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_installing-a-supported-ssh-client).

## Installation

1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=okteto.remote-kubernetes).
1. Install the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension.
1. [Download and configure](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/) your `kubeconfig` file.

## Getting started

There is a complete tutorial [here](https://okteto.com/blog/remote-kubernetes-development/). The steps can be summarized as follows:

1. Clone https://github.com/okteto/vscode-remote-go
1. Start VS Code
1. Run the `Okteto: Up` command to launch your development environment in Kubernetes. When prompted, pick the `okteto.yml` manifest. 
1. After a few seconds, you'll be asked to select a host. Pick the `vscode-remote-go.okteto` entry from the dialog to launch your remote VS Code instance.
1. Develop directly in Kubernetes from VS Code!
