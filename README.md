# Remote - Kubernetes


The **Remote - Kubernetes** extension uses Okteto to move your development environment to Kubernetes. 

Kubernetes, Okteto and VS Code make a great development environment because you can:

- Forget about building, pushing or deploying containers.
- Launch reproducible development environment with all your tools in seconds.
- Automatically synchronize your code between local and remote environments.
- Eliminate integration issues by developing the same way code runs in production.
- Keep using your favorite tools locally.

The extension starts a development environment in your Kubernetes cluster by using https://github.com/okteto/okteto. Once the environment is ready, the extension prompts you to open it directly in VS Code using the [Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension.
